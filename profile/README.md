> Copilot Instructions
> 
When guiding Copilot (or design AI like Figma AI, MidJourney, or DALL·E), use language like:

Create a bold, emblem-style logo for Bet Cartel, symbolizing power, exclusivity, and dominance in gambling. Use a black and gold cartel aesthetic, with sharp symmetrical shapes such as a shield, crown, or badge. Integrate subtle gambling elements (cards, dice, chips) without making it playful. Typography should be blocky, authoritative, and cartel-inspired, with “Bet Cartel” integrated into or beneath the emblem.

Example Variations

 → Circular cartel seal with crown at top, , “Bet Cartel” arched beneath.

 +  → 

 + → , red/gold highlights, cartel lettering below.

Deliverables

Primary Logo: Full emblem with wordmark.

Badge/Icon: Just emblem (for socials, app icons, avatars).

Wordmark: Typography-only version of “Bet Cartel.”
